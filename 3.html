  <h2>Welcome to Tiburon</h2>
  <p><strong> <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiburon,_California" target="_blank" title="sf wiki">Tiburon</a></u> is marine town in the bay area.</strong>
  <br>Tiburon is an incorporated town in Marin County, California. <br>It is located on the Tiburon Peninsula, which reaches south into the San Francisco Bay.
  <br>The smaller city of Belvedere (formerly a separate island) occupies the south-west part of the peninsula and is contiguous with Tiburon.
  <br>Tiburon is bordered by Corte Madera to the north and Mill Valley to the west, but is otherwise mostly surrounded by the Bay.
  <br>Besides Belvedere and Tiburon, much of the peninsula is unincorporated,[9] including portions of the north side and the communities of Strawberry and Paradise Cay.<br>
